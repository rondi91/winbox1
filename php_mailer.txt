Implementing email notifications in your application can significantly enhance user engagement and keep your users informed about important events, such as successful payments, upcoming billing, or changes in their account status. Below, I'll guide you through the steps required to implement email notifications.

Steps to Implement Email Notifications
Choose an Email Sending Library: Use PHP's built-in mail() function or a more robust library like PHPMailer or SwiftMailer.
Set Up Email Configuration: Configure SMTP settings for sending emails.
Create a Notification Function: Implement a function to handle sending emails.
Trigger Email Notifications: Call the notification function whenever a relevant event occurs (e.g., when a payment is made).
1. Choose an Email Sending Library
For this implementation, I recommend using PHPMailer for its simplicity and extensive features. You can install it via Composer:

bash
Copy code
composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
2. Set Up Email Configuration
You'll need to set up SMTP settings to send emails. Create a configuration file (e.g., email_config.php) to hold your SMTP credentials:

php
Copy code
<?php
// email_config.php
return [
    'host' => 'smtp.example.com', // SMTP server address
    'username' => 'your_email@example.com', // Your email address
    'password' => 'your_password', // Your email password
    'port' => 587, // SMTP port (e.g., 587 for TLS)
    'encryption' => 'tls' // Encryption method
];
3. Create a Notification Function
Implement a function to send emails. You can add this function in a new file (e.g., email_notifications.php):

php
Copy code
<?php
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

require 'vendor/autoload.php'; // Load Composer's autoloader

function sendEmailNotification($to, $subject, $body) {
    $config = include 'email_config.php'; // Include email configuration

    $mail = new PHPMailer(true); // Create a new PHPMailer instance
    try {
        // Server settings
        $mail->isSMTP();
        $mail->Host = $config['host'];
        $mail->SMTPAuth = true;
        $mail->Username = $config['username'];
        $mail->Password = $config['password'];
        $mail->SMTPSecure = $config['encryption'];
        $mail->Port = $config['port'];

        // Recipients
        $mail->setFrom($config['username'], 'Your Company Name');
        $mail->addAddress($to); // Add a recipient

        // Content
        $mail->isHTML(true); // Set email format to HTML
        $mail->Subject = $subject;
        $mail->Body    = $body;

        $mail->send();
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        echo "Message could not be sent. Mailer Error: {$mail->ErrorInfo}";
    }
}
?>
4. Trigger Email Notifications
Call the sendEmailNotification function whenever a relevant event occurs. For example, you can send an email notification when a payment is successfully processed. In your payment handling code (like in payments.php or add_payment.php), you can add the following after saving the payment record:

php
Copy code
// Example of triggering an email notification
$emailTo = $customerEmail; // Get the customer's email address
$subject = "Payment Confirmation";
$body = "
    <h1>Payment Confirmation</h1>
    <p>Dear $customerName,</p>
    <p>Your payment of <strong>Rp. $amount</strong> has been successfully processed.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your business!</p>
";

sendEmailNotification($emailTo, $subject, $body);
Example Scenario: Payment Success Notification
You can integrate the email notification in your payment processing code. Hereâ€™s a brief example of how to incorporate it when a new payment is added:

php
Copy code
// Handle form submission for creating a new payment record
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST' && isset($_POST['action'])) {
    if ($_POST['action'] === 'add') {
        $newPayment = [
            'payment_id' => count($payments['payments']) + 1, // Auto-increment ID
            'billing_id' => $_POST['billing_id'],
            'payment_date' => date('Y-m-d'), // Current date
            'amount' => $_POST['amount'],
            'payment_method' => $_POST['payment_method'],
        ];

        // Append the new payment and save to the JSON file
        $payments['payments'][] = $newPayment;
        savePayments($payments);

        // Get customer details (like email and name)
        $customerEmail = ''; // Fetch this from the billing or customers data
        $customerName = ''; // Fetch this from the billing or customers data

        // Send email notification
        $subject = "Payment Confirmation";
        $body = "
            <h1>Payment Confirmation</h1>
            <p>Dear $customerName,</p>
            <p>Your payment of <strong>Rp. {$newPayment['amount']}</strong> has been successfully processed.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your business!</p>
        ";

        sendEmailNotification($customerEmail, $subject, $body);
        header('Location: payments.php'); // Redirect to the same page
        exit;
    }
}
